# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction-Based-on-Historical-Payment-Information
Term project on Multivariate Data Analysis course
The data is collected from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php, which contains customer credit payment information and default status in Taiwan for nine months. Several models are built to predict whether a client will default from 24 attributes of clients by conducting linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, and neural network analysis. PCA is also used to realize dimension reduction.
